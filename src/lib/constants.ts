export const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How much caffeine is in Game Plan?",
    answer:
      "Each serving contains 100mg of natural caffeine from green tea — roughly equivalent to one cup of coffee. Paired with 200mg of L-Theanine, it delivers smooth, focused energy without jitters or crash.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should I drink it?",
    answer:
      "For best results, mix one stick pack into cold water 15-30 minutes before your round. You can also sip it throughout your round to maintain hydration and focus. Many golfers keep a second pack for the back nine.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it safe to take daily?",
    answer:
      "Yes! All ingredients are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and dosed within clinically studied ranges. Game Plan is third-party tested for purity and potency. As with any supplement, consult your doctor if you have specific health concerns.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it taste like?",
    answer:
      'Our Citrus Greens flavor has a clean, refreshing citrus taste with subtle green tea notes. No artificial sweeteners, no chalky texture — just smooth, easy-drinking hydration. We\'ve heard "it actually tastes good" more times than we can count.',

    answer:
      "Game Plan is designed to optimize the mental and physical factors that impact your performance: focus, energy, hydration, and stress management.
